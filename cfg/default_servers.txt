; This file is used for the servers list if the metaserver is unavailable.
; This file could be useful if the metaserver were down for a long period
; and nobody would have a php server to replace it.
; Each server is represented by a line always containing:
; - the IP address (or the URL)
; - the server name (sound number or login without space)
; - the port (2500 is the default).
; These fields must be separated by spaces.
