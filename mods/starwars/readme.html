<h1 id="1"> 1: The races </h1>
There are two races in the Star wars mod. <br>
These do not equate to good an evil and are built as closely as possible to the two forces known in the starwars films. 
<hr>
<h1 id="#1.1"> 1.1: The Empire </h1>
One of the bigger forces, and arguably, more powerful force in starwars is the empire. <br>
They use fearce battle droids and sith warriors to decimate there foes in ruthless asults. <br>
This race is shown in this mod. <br>
<hr>
<h1 id="1.2"> 1.2: The rebbles. </h1>
The rebbles, or the republic, are a smaller group of warriors who are a republic from the empire. <br>
When the jedi and sith go to war, so does the empire and the rebbles. <br>
The rebbles use sweeping but yet still devistating asults to slowly crush the empire in its own power. <br>
This race is represented as the rebble alliance in the mod.
